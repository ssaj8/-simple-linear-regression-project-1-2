# -simple-linear-regression-project-1-2
End-to-end regression projects using Simple Linear Regression to predict Delivery Time and Salary Hike. Includes EDA, Excel models.
Build a simple linear regression model by performing EDA and do necessary transformations and select the best model using Python.
There are two datasets which are shared - 
1. Delivery Time 
	Objective  - Is to predict the Delivery time using Sorting time

2. Salary Hike
	Objective -  Is to build a prediction model for Salary Hike.
**# Prediction with Regression

This repository contains two end-to-end regression use cases using Simple Linear Regression:

---

## 📌 1. Delivery Time Prediction

- **Objective**: Predict Delivery Time based on Sorting Time.
- **Solution**: Built a Simple Linear Regression model after performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and necessary transformations.
- **Business Impact**: Helps optimize logistics by estimating delivery time based on sorting time, improving operational efficiency.

## 📌 2. Salary Hike Prediction

- **Objective**: Build a prediction model for Salary Hike.
- **Solution**: Built a Simple Linear Regression model using EDA and transformations.
- **Business Impact**: Provides insights for HR and management to structure compensation strategies effectively.
